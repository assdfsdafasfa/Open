# Bug list
All bugs identified in the case study are explained in detail so that they could be validated by other researchers. The bug list is publicly available [here](https://assdfsdafasfa.github.io/). 

For each bug, we present the code before and after refactoring, the expected results, explanations, and error messages generated by compilers(if there is any)

# How to reproduce the case study

**1.Requirements**

. JDK == 17

• Eclipse, version 2024.3 

• NetBeans, version 21 

• VScode-java, version 1.22.0 

• IntelliJ IDEA, version 2024.1

**2.Step-by-step tutorial**

Download the implementation at: git clone git@github.com:assdfsdafasfa/OpenPaper.git

1. A tool that performs automated execution of refactoring by calling refactoring engines([Auto-RefactoringbyEclipse](https://github.com/assdfsdafasfa/OpenPaper/tree/main/Implementation/Eclipse_AutoRefactor) and [Auto-RefactoringbyIDEA](https://github.com/assdfsdafasfa/OpenPaper/tree/main/Implementation/IDEA_AutoRefactor)) API.

(1) Import Project

import->Existing Projects into Workspace->Auto-RefactoringbyEclipse->plugin.xml->Launch an Eclipse application

(2) Sequential run refactoring in Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, and Save code after refactoring.

(3) Compare Refactoring Codes.
