You are an expert in testing refactoring engines. 
Your task is to summarize what kind of features a test Java program should have so that it could trigger the same bug in 'extract variable refactoring' as the following test program trigger:
Notably, "features" refer to code entities with specific characters as well as relationships among such entities. 
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [error message] 

To make it clear, we present the following three examples to illustrate how to extract different features that result in a bug during the extract variable refactoring process. 
Example 1
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [error message] 
The summarized features: [Features]
Example 2
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [error message] 
The summarized features: [Features]
Example 3
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [error message] 
The summarized features: [Features]
