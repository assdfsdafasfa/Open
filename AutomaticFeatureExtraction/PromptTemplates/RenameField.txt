You are an expert in testing refactoring engines. 
Your task is to summarize what kind of features a test Java program should have so that it could trigger the same bug in 'rename field refactoring' as the following test program trigger:
Notably, "features" refer to code entities with specific characters as well as relationships among such entities. 
The given test program that triggers a bug of rename field refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of rename field refactoring: [error message] 

To make it clear, we present the following three examples to illustrate how to extract different features that result in a bug during the rename field refactoring process. 
Example 1
The given test program that triggers a bug of rename field refactoring : [public class Hider3 {
    private int myField = 7;
    private class InnerClass {
        public void instanceContext(int param3) {
            int localVar3 = 0;
            int var1 = localVar3 + param3 + myField;
        }
    }
}]
The error messages of rename field refactoring: [ when renaming the field myField to param3 or localVar3, the refactoring incorrectly resolves the reference to this.param3 or this.localVar3 within the InnerClass.] 
The summarized features: [
1. Rename a field class that contains an inner class
2. Inner classes contain local variables
3. An assignment statement includes renaming fields and assigning local variables]
Example 2
The given test program that triggers a bug of rename field refactoring : [public class Foo {
    public int x;
    public void foo() {
        int y = 0;
        y = x + 1;
    }
    public class Inner {
        public int z;
        public void foo() {
            z = x + 1;
        }
    }
}
]
The error messages of rename field refactoring: [The error occurs due to a naming conflict between the field isEnabled and the constructor parameter isEnabled, which causes the constructor to incorrectly assign the parameter to itself instead of the field.] 
The summarized features: [
1. Rename a field class that contains an inner class
2. The inner class contains additional field declarations
3. An assignment statement in the inner class that contains the renamed field and the declared field in the inner class]
Example 3
The given test program that triggers a bug of rename field refactoring : [public class Bean {
    private boolean isVisible;
    public Bean(boolean visible) {
        isVisible = visible;
    }
}]
The error messages of rename field refactoring: [
The error occurs due to a naming conflict between the field isEnabled and the constructor parameter isEnabled, which causes the constructor to incorrectly assign the parameter to itself instead of the field.] 
The summarized features: [
1. A class contains 'private' renamed field. 
2. A statement that contains a parameter assigned to the renamed field. 
3. The class contains construction method]
