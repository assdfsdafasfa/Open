You are an expert in testing refactoring engines. 
Your task is to summarize what kind of features a test Java program should have so that it could trigger the same bug in 'extract variable refactoring' as the following test program trigger:
Notably, "features" refer to code entities with specific characters as well as relationships among such entities. 
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [error message] 

To make it clear, we present the following three examples to illustrate how to extract different features that result in a bug during the extract variable refactoring process. 
Example 1
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [
public class A {
	public static Object bar;

	void foo() {
		return new Object();
	}
}  
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [The error occurs because the result of new Object() is a temporary value,  leading to incorrect or redundant code. ] 
The summarized features: [
1. The class contains a static field of type Object that is not used within the method.
2. The method contains a return statement that creates and returns a new instance of a class. However, the return type is missing in the method signature, which causes a compilation error.
3. A static field is declared but not used anywhere in the method or class, potentially leading to an unnecessary declaration.]
Example 2
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [class A {
	int field= 17;
	void run() {
		System.out.println(this.field);
	}
} ]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [The error occurs because extracting this.field into a new variable is unnecessary, as this.field already references an instance variable, leading to redundant or incorrect refactoring.] 
The summarized features: [
1. The class contains an integer field that is initialized with a constant value.
2. A method exists that prints the value of the instance field to the console.
3. The method uses the 'this' keyword to access the field, making it explicit that the field belongs to the current object.
4. The method is designed to output the value of the field when invoked.
5. The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class, although it could be omitted in this case.]
Example 3
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract variable refactoring : [
class Example  {
    void foo(int value) {
        class Local {
            void bar() {
                Runnable runnable = () -> {
                    System.out.println(value);
                };
            }
        }
    }
}]
The error messages of extract variable refactoring: [The error occurs because the refactoring introduces an unnecessary parameter when extracting the method, as the value is already in scope within the new method, making the parameter redundant.] 
The summarized features: [
1. An inner class is defined within a method, encapsulating certain behavior.
2. A lambda expression is used within the method, referencing a variable from the enclosing scope.
3. The lambda captures and utilizes a variable from the method's scope, demonstrating how inner methods can access variables from their enclosing context.
4. The lambda is assigned to a variable of a functional interface type, allowing delayed execution of the logic it encapsulates.]
