You are an expert in testing refactoring engines. 
Your task is to summarize what kind of features a test Java program should have so that it could trigger the same bug in 'extract method refactoring' as the following test program trigger:
Notably, "features" refer to code entities with specific characters as well as relationships among such entities. 
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract method refactoring : [Source Code]
The error messages of extract method refactoring: [error message] 

To make it clear, we present the following three examples to illustrate how to extract different features that result in a bug during the extract method refactoring process. 
Example 1
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract method refactoring : [
public class SeparateInit {
    public void context1() {
        int v;
        v = 4;
    }
    public void context2() {
        int v;
        v = 4;
    }
}]
The error messages of extract method refactoring: [The refactoring engine failed to detect duplicate code elements during the execution of the "Extract Method" refactoring.] 
The summarized features: [
1. The class should define two separate methods.
2. Two methods contain the same method body.
3. The extracted statement is an assignment expression. ]
Example 2
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract method refactoring : [
public <T> T method(Class<T> clazz) {
    System.out.println();
    return null;
}
]
The error messages of extract method refactoring: [Te extracted method incorrectly retains the generic type <T> in its declaration, even though it does not use the generic parameter. ] 
The summarized features: [
1. The method is declared with a generic type parameter <T> and includes a return type dependent on the generic parameter.
2. The code contains a simple statement eligible for method extraction.
3. The extracted statement oes not depend on or interact with the generic type <T>.]
Example 3
The given test program that triggers a bug of extract method refactoring : [
class ExtractMethBug {
    void meth() {
        String name;
    }
}]
The error messages of extract method refactoring: [The extracted method is incorrectly declared to return a String but does not return anything, resulting in a compilation error.] 
The summarized features: [1. The class defines a single method.
2. The method contains a single uninitialized variable declaration.
3. The extracted code consists of a variable declaration statement.]
